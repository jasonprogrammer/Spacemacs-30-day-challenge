The spacemacs 30 day challenge
==============================

*Hi there! I am still using spacemacs, and it is still very much awesome. Unfortunately, I won't have time to return to this project before christmas. I was considering removing this repo, but there was some good feedback. So I am leaving it here for now, with the promise that I will return to this project in the new year*

1 How this course is structured
-------------------------------

Learning Spacemacs takes some time, especially if you are new to Emacs, and/or Vim and/or most of the Emacs packages which are assembled in Spacemacs. Chances are that you won't have much fun if you start using Spacemacs for your day-to-day work right away. A better approach is to first learn how to use Spacemacs well, with dedicated lessons and examples.  Then you can use it for your work without too many "how-can-I-do-that-again" moments interrupting your newly acquired Spacemacs working flow. 

This course offers you a way to learn Spacemacs (including vim if you don't know it yet) in a few weeks, by spending 30 min every day on a topic from a well structured curriculum. You can become a Spacemacs power user in 30 days, with minimal per-day effort. Are you ready to take the challenge? Then read on!

Still there? Great, then let's turn you into a keyboard Jedi! And the sweetest thing: you don't have to choose one side of the force - here you will get the best of both vim and emacs, courtesy of the awesome Spacemacs team! 

The course has two main parts: a collection of **core modules**, teaching you the basics every spacemacs user should know. This includes, for example, basic knowledge of vim shortcuts or of the Emacs environment in which Spacemacs lives. Once you have got those basics down, you can cherry pick further modules from the **specialty section** depending on your personal requirements. For example, you could go for the module describing how to use your favorite programming language in Spacemacs, or you could decide to first go for one of the many possibilities that org-mode has to offer. Finally, for every specialty, you can decide how deep you want to dive into the topic: depending on the topic, up to three skill levels can be achieved: **Stormtropper**, **Padawan** and **Jedi**.

Take a look at the planned table of content of the course to get an idea of what is waiting for you in the coming days:
